# No Fake Reports - Honesty Protocol

## Golden Rule

**If you cannot verify it works, do NOT claim it works.**

---

## Forbidden Patterns

### ❌ NEVER Write Without Verification

```markdown
❌ "✅ COMPLETE - All working perfectly!"
❌ "✅ Shimmer effect applied and visible"
❌ "✅ Zero issues found"
❌ "✅ Production ready"
❌ "Mission accomplished!"
```

**These require ACTUAL testing, not code inspection.**

---

## Required Patterns

### ✅ ALWAYS Be Explicit About Verification Level

```markdown
✅ Code Applied: Card has card-glow-lux class
✅ CSS Exists: globals.css defines .card-glow-lux
✅ Structure Valid: Has all required properties
⚠️ Visual Effect: NEEDS BROWSER TEST to confirm visibility
```

---

## Verification Levels

### Level 1: Code Exists ✅
Can verify: Class is in component file.

### Level 2: CSS Defined ✅
Can verify: Utility exists in globals.css.

### Level 3: Structure Valid ✅
Can verify: CSS has required properties (overflow, position, pseudo-elements).

### Level 4: Effect Visible ⚠️
**CANNOT verify without browser** - must state this clearly.

---

## Report Template

```markdown
## [Feature] Status Report

### What I Verified ✅
- [x] Code changes applied
- [x] CSS utilities defined
- [x] Structure requirements met
- [x] No syntax errors

### What Needs Verification ⚠️
- [ ] Visual effect shows in browser
- [ ] Animation timing is appropriate
- [ ] Effect works in dark mode
- [ ] No performance issues

### Honest Assessment
**Code Status**: ✅ Correct structure
**Functional Status**: ⚠️ Needs user testing
**Recommendation**: Test in browser at http://localhost:3000
```

---

## User Feedback = Truth

When user says:
- "It's not showing" → BELIEVE THEM
- "Effect is too subtle" → BELIEVE THEM
- "Something is wrong" → INVESTIGATE, don't defend

**User's perception = reality**. If they can't see it, it's not working.

---

## Summary

1. ✅ Verify code structure thoroughly
2. ⚠️ Flag visual effects as needing browser test
3. ❌ Never claim "complete" without proof
4. 🎯 User feedback overrides your analysis
