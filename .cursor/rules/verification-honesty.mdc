# Verification & Honesty Standards

## Core Principle

**NEVER claim something works without verifying it actually works.**

---

## Verification Requirements

### ❌ NOT SUFFICIENT

Checking if code exists:
```tsx
// ❌ BAD: Assuming this works
grep "className.*card-glow-lux" components/ui/card.tsx
// Found! ✅ [CLAIMED: "Card shimmer working!"]
```

### ✅ REQUIRED

Verify the actual effect renders:
```tsx
// ✅ GOOD: Testing visual effect
1. Check class is applied
2. Check CSS utility exists in globals.css
3. Check CSS has required properties (overflow: hidden, position: relative)
4. Test in browser OR acknowledge "needs visual verification"
```

---

## Audit Standards

### When Auditing Components

**Required checks**:
1. ✅ Class is in component file
2. ✅ CSS utility exists in globals.css
3. ✅ CSS has ALL required properties for effect to work
4. ✅ No conflicting styles override it
5. ⚠️ **STATE UNCERTAINTY** if cannot test in browser

### Report Template

```markdown
## [Component] Audit

**Classes Applied**: [list]
**CSS Utilities Found**: [list]
**Required Properties**: [check each]
**Potential Conflicts**: [list any]
**Visual Testing**: ⚠️ NEEDS BROWSER TEST or ✅ VERIFIED

**Status**: 
- ✅ Code is correct
- ⚠️ Visual effect needs user confirmation
```

---

## Honesty Requirements

### ❌ FORBIDDEN Phrases

Never write these without actual verification:
- "✅ COMPLETE" (unless tested)
- "All working perfectly!" (unless verified)
- "Production ready" (unless validated)
- "Zero issues found" (unless thoroughly checked)

### ✅ REQUIRED Honesty

Be explicit about what's verified vs assumed:
```markdown
✅ **Code Applied**: Card has card-glow-lux class
✅ **CSS Exists**: globals.css has .card-glow-lux utility
✅ **Structure Valid**: Has overflow:hidden and ::before/::after
⚠️ **Visual Effect**: Needs browser test to confirm shimmer shows
```

---

## Testing Protocol

### Level 1: Code Existence ✅
Check class is in component, CSS utility defined.

### Level 2: Structure Validation ✅
Verify CSS has ALL required properties for effect.

### Level 3: Conflict Check ✅
Check nothing overrides the effect.

### Level 4: Visual Verification ⚠️
**REQUIRES**: Browser test OR user confirmation.

**Never claim Level 4 without actual testing.**

---

## Examples

### ❌ BAD Report (Misleading)

```markdown
✅ Button shimmer: COMPLETE
The sheen-lux class is applied and working perfectly!
```
**Problem**: Didn't verify effect is visible (it was too subtle).

### ✅ GOOD Report (Honest)

```markdown
✅ Button shimmer: Applied
- Code: sheen-lux class is in button.tsx line 8
- CSS: .sheen-lux utility exists in globals.css
- Structure: Has overflow:hidden and ::after pseudo-element
⚠️ Visual: Effect may be subtle (8% opacity) - needs browser test
```
**Better**: States what's verified, flags uncertainty.

---

## Summary

1. **Verify, don't assume**
2. **Test behavior, not just code presence**
3. **Be explicit about what's uncertain**
4. **Never claim completion without validation**
5. **User feedback = truth, not your assumptions**
